# SC-Automator

After weeks of work, I present to you, SC Automator! This tool uses [SC-Compression by Vorono4ka](https://github.com/danila-schelkov/sc-compression) and [SC2FLA by Daniil-SV](https://github.com/Daniil-SV/) to automate CSV & TOML decryption and SC & SCTX conversion of Supercell's game files. Generally used as a support for modding and datamining.

# INSTRUCTIONS AND PREREQUISITES:

**DO NOT MOVE, RENAME OR DELETE ANY FOLDER OR THEIR SUBFOLDERS.**
**A MINIMUM OF 1GB RAM IS REQUIRED.**
**PYTHON MUST BE ADDED TO PATH ENVIRONMENT.**

Step 1: Install Python 3.10+. DURING INSTALLATION, SELECT "ADD TO PATH"

Step 2: Verify installation. Open cmd, enter `python --version`. You should get an output: `Python <version>`

Step 3: Run `setup.bat`. The script deletes itself after performing the setup.

Step 4: Install the game apk file from a webite like UptoDown. Rename `.apk` to `.zip`

Step 5: Copy over the `assets` folder in its entirety (from the zip), to the main folder.

Step 6: Run `%Automator.bat`

Step 7: Wait for everything to get converted/decompressed (May take upto an hour).

Step 8: Run `%CleanUp.bat` to free storage/perform a full reset.
